"#01017","Hello there!"
"#01018","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Nice to meet you!<br>First of all, let me tell you how happy I am to be your secretary at this game studio.<br>I feel it in my bones that we'll create lots of bestselling games!<br><br>I'll be sharing some hints with you to get you started.<br>Today, a note about Stamina: it refills even when you're not playing.<br>Don't let it sit there gathering dust when it's full, but also take care not to run out of it when you need it.<br>That's it for today!"
"#01019","Hello again!"
"#01020","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Just thought I should mention that closing the game when data is being transferred, or saved, is best to be avoided as it can result in data loss!<br>You probably knew it already, but I wanted to make sure..."
"#01021","Today's Memorandum"
"#01022","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Open the app every day and you'll get PF Knowledge!<br>It's needed for developing gaming platforms, so get as much as you can. It's also useful for outsourcing.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01023","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>There are certain items which have a positive influence on your staff, giving them power up bonuses!<br>So it's worth finding out about your staff's likes and hobbies.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01024","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>If you'd like to find some new recruits, it's a good idea to hold meetings and develop new games first.<br>Got to have something that'll attract people to your company!<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01025","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Your staff can recover HP by using furniture which grants that effect.<br>They also naturally recover when the work is passed on to another department.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01026","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>It's a no-brainer, but the way to get more users is to release good games people will want to play. Let's try to get our studio lots of faithful fans! That's all I have for you today."
"#01027","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Found some idea modules?<br>Then it's time to outsource work to your friends.<br>You can have them work on some projects for you while your teams are busy with something else, or you can work on your friends' projects too.<br>Outsourcing to friends is extra effective! That's all I have for you today."
"#01028","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>You need programmers on your teams when developing games, or else the team's stats will really suffer.<br>Well-balanced teams are more effective.<br>Keep an eye on the costs and assign people to the teams where they'll be the most useful.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01029","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Which themes are popular depends on the day of the week.<br>Games featuring the popular themes will get more downloads, and they'll get you more idea modules too.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01030","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>There are certain very special items which you can use on your staff to upgrade their occupation.<br>Raising their stats and upgrading their jobs will make them even better employees!<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01031","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Don't forget to raise the Management Level.<br>It's one more contributing factor to making your studio successful.<br>To do that you'll need to save up some money and get specific items.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01032","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>The more knowhow you have, the higher the quality of the games developed by your teams.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01033","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>The age groups different gaming platforms appeal to vary.<br>Check which age groups our studio's fans fall into and release games on the platforms they prefer to get more downloads.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01034","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>What human resources we can get depends on the studio head<br>Talented people are more likely to apply to our studio if there's a charismatic, skilled boss they can trust.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01035","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>You might want to remodel some floors once you get more staff.<br><br>Go to Add Floors and tap the left icon to select ""Remodel.""<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01036","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>What furniture is on sale depends on the day of the week and the time of the day as well!<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01037","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>When the themes and features of a game are compatible, you'll have better chances of discovering items.<br>But if they don't really go well together, you'll get more bugs.<br>Debugging gets you Meeting Points though, so it's good to select it every now and then.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01038","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Gaming platforms created by different companies gradually get more users over time, but some are more popular than others.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01039","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Make use of assistamts to develop outstanding games!<br>Staff skills also play a huge role during development, so use them to your advantage.<br>That's all I have for you today."

"#01041","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Don't stop at the domestic.<br>Release games globally when you're ready.<br>And don't deprive yourself of the occasional beach vacation.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01042","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Once you get enough staff, you can even make your own gaming platform.<br>You'll need more floors to house all your staff, so exchange gifts with your friends to make that possible.<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01043","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>When your games get good reviews, they'll enter the Hall of Fame and you'll be able to make sequels!<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01044","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>Reach development goals to win trophies.<br>You can also win amazing prizes for getting certain trophies!<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01045","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>I don't know if it's true, but I heard that you can get different assistants on different days of the week, and goods on sale in stores change daily too!<br>That's all I have for you today."
"#01046","- Mary's Memorandum -<br>The higher the studio's rank, the higher the Motivation cap for your staff.<br>And the more Motivation, the better their stats!<br>This is a bit of an off-topic, but my special abilities are mostly mad pro wrestling moves.<br>That's, err, all I have for you today."
"#01047","- Mary's Daily Fortune -<br>Today will be a pretty good day for you.<br>Your lucky items are...2kg Gold Bars!<br>That's all I have for you today."

"#01333","Congratulations on ranking up!<br><br>I'm writing to you from Hawaii this time. I'm really enjoying my vacation!<br><br>It's time for you to conquer the overseas markets too, don't you think?<br>That way you'll surely keep ranking up higher and higher!"
"#01334","Congratulations on ranking up...<br><br>I'm back from vacation and my motivation is hitting an all-time low…<br>Your staff's motivation goes up naturally as you rank up, but for me…<br>Nothing below rank 99 satisfies me, really.<br>Well, good luck to you."

"#01336","Congratulations on ranking up!<br>Sorry about sounding so dispirited in my last email.<br>I've moved to a different state now, and that really energized me.<br>I feel 10 years younger, haha!<br>I'm even thinking of starting up a new company to compete with yours!<br>Good luck to you and watch out, I may become a serious rival! Just kidding!"
"#01337","Congratulations on ranking up!<br>Buuut, you know what?<br>Remember I told you last time I was considering setting up my own company?<br>I did, and it's doing so fabulously well it's not far away from your rank now!<br>Muahaha!<br>You better try extra hard now, or I'll overtake you!"
"#01338","Ranking Asso. Chairman, Alaska"
"#01339","Congrats on ranking up...<br>Since my last email, my company was hit hard by market fluctuations, and I had to file for bankruptcy...<br>I've taken what money I had left and bought a small place in Alaska, where I'm now enjoying a simpler life, mostly watching snow fall.<br>I hope you're still doing well.<br>I guess you are, since you keep going up in rank.<br>I wish you better luck than mine."
"#01340","Heh heh heh!<br>Congratulations on ranking up!<br>I have discovered a passion for fishing, and it seems I'm amazing at it, so I've been traveling all over the country casting my line here and there.<br>I think I can keep my position as the chairman until you make it to rank 99.<br>It's the final stretch!<br>You can do it!<br>Oooh, looks like I caught a big one!"
"#01341","Ranking Asso. Chairman, Singapore"
"#01342","You did it, you champ!<br>You got to rank 99! Whoa!<br>I teared up a little when I heard the good news.<br>It seems like it was only yesterday that your game studio published its first game...<br>I remember it as clearly as what I had for dinner last night! As for me, I won the lottery the other day, quit my job, and moved abroad.<br>It's been awesome knowing you and watching over your journey from a small start-up to a studio the whole world knows about.<br>Now, each of us must walk a separate path.<br>Good luck, friend!"

,"I've been so careless!<br><br>Bleep boop boop..."
,"Me? A <co=0066cc>helper</co>? Okay then."
"#02222","How precious. Me, a <co=0066cc>helper</co>?"
,"I was just about to go on my break, so I'll have to mull it over. Good day."
"#02223","Oh nooo! I was lured in by that tantalizing banana!"
,"I'll do anything, be your <co=0066cc>helper</co> or whatever it is you need. Just please, please give me that banana from the trap!"
"#02224","Well, call me a bear! You got me with that sweet honey aroma."
,"To be so easily tricked like this... I'm not angry at you, just disappointed in myself."
,"Looks like I'll be your <co=0066cc>helper</co> for the time being."
"#02225","Hey. I got bored of making tapestries out of bank notes."
,"Please let me be your <co=0066cc>helper</co> while you develop games. Thanks."
"#02226","I've come to merge and acquire another excellent company."
,"You know, I've bought over 80 companies already, and was thinking it's about time I head home."
,"I can be your <co=0066cc>helper</co> while I wait for my private jet to fuel up, I suppose."
"#02227","Greetings. I am Kairoman. A friend of the ultimate game developing AI, Kairobot."
,"I guarantee that I will be an amazing helper, and will always remember to bring snacks!"
,"This'll be fun!"
"#02228","Wh-what?! You want me as your helper?"
,"You're a strange one. You know I'm just a regular old Kappa, right?"
"#02229","Hello there. I'm good at digging holes and tightening screws. I am Drill Kairo!"
,"I made a whole bunch of holes in some walls the other day. I think I'm just the right helper for you!"
"#02230","Well, hello! I'm a helper!"
,"I'd be more than happy to help you out. While I'm at it, don't mind if I help myself to your snacks as well!"
"#02231","N-n-n-n-nice to meet you!"
,"As a beloved defender of justice, allow me to become a helper at your company!"
"#02232","Hey. I'm the first panda to ever be involved in game development."
,"I'll try to do my best as a helper supporting your company. I'm excited for our future partnership."
"#02233","Hello! Thank you for always choosing our services."
,"As a token of my eternal gratitude, I would like to offer my services as a helper. Please use me as you see fit."
"#02234","A helper? Sure, I wasn't doing much anyway."
"#02235","You want me, an idol, to be a helper at your game developer company?!"
,"I'll do it! Whether it's C++ or assembly, I'll try my best!"
"#02236","So, this is a short break from working as the CEO's assistant."
"#02237","Heh heh. I've already got my hands on my next golden goose. It's money making time!"
,"I learned a lot during my time here. Hopefully, we can meet again soon."
"#02238","My mega-battery! I'm running out of juice! I better head home and plug myself in."
,"Bye-bye."
"#02239","Looks like I've saved up enough for another world tour. Guess I'll be on my way, then."
,"Next stop, Monaco. Or maybe even Iowa. Goodbye!"
"#02240","Uh-oh. The situation that I feared all along has finally happened. We've run out of bananas."
,"I must set out on an arduous journey across the sea to find the banana of legends. Bye, now!"
"#02241","Whoa! Looks like it's time for me to head home!"
,"Can't leave my main business unattended, after all. I'll see you around!"
"#02242","Whoa now!"
,"I forgot that the game I preordered has been released today. Laters!"
"#02243","Oops! The next offer to appear in a game has come up."
,"I'll be playing a secretary, so better go renew my secretary license right away."
,"I'm also thinking of growing an afro. Do you think it'll suit me?"
"#02244","Oh... My face got all dirty and now I can't use my powers anymore."
,"I'm off to go buy some face packs. Maybe I'll see you around?"
"#02245","Oh man! My head's getting real dry."
,"This is no joking matter. I gotta go and get a humidifier on the double."
"#02246","Oh dear, my drill's getting kinda weak."
,"I'm going to have to head out to the appliance store in search of the charger of miracles."
"#02247","OMG!"
,"The grocery store I go to is having a 50% sale on everything! See ya!"
"#02248","Heh heh. Just when we'd finally become friends..."
,"I noticed that I'm not actually wearing any pants. I better go home and put some on. Sorry about that."
"#02249","What a pandamonium! I've run out of bamboo stock."
,"My diet, which is definitely not a fad, requires that I only eat the finest bamboo leaves. I have to go stock up again. Bye."
"#02250","Do you have a minute, Boss?"
,"The time has come to stock up on more product, so I must head out into the big, wide world. I hope we meet again someday."
"#02251","F-finally!"
,"I've gotten an acting request from the famous Kairobot, so I better make my way back. Let's meet again sometime."
"#02252","Welp, I'm getting hungry, so I'll take my leave for now."
,"Buh-bye!"
"#02253","Everyone, please gather round."
,"I, Peachie, have decided to leave the game developing world to continue my idol career! Don't forget to come to my concerts!"
"#02254","Oh my, I think Mini Kairobot has got a stomach ache. I'm going to have to take him to the nurse's room."
,"See ya!"
"#02255","Time for the CEO to shine."
"#02256","It's my turn at last!"
,"Take that!"
"#02257","Here we go!"
"#02258","Looks like it's my turn!"
,"Hya! Hya! Hyaaaaaar!"
"#02259","Wuh-oh! Here I go!"
,"Ho-haaaaaa!"
"#02260","Leave this to me!"
,"Booyaaa!"
"#02261","Huh? You want me to get to work?"
,"Very well. I'll show you what I can do!"
"#02262","Whoa! The stocks I bought recently have shot up in price. Don't worry, my mind's on the task at hand... Mmm, money."
"#02263","'Ave summa thaaat!"
"#02264","Oh? You need some Kappa power?"
,"You got it!"
"#02265","Oof!"
"#02266","Huh?! Kinda in the middle of snacking, you know!"
,"T-tastey snaaacks!"
"#02267","Time to pull back the veil, or should I say underwear, on my secret."
,"And reveal to the world what I'm really made of! Here I go!"
"#02268","Kapooow!"
"#02269","Understood. I'll take care of it immediately!"
"#02270","I'm staaarving!"
"#02271","*burp*"
"#02272","Leave this to me!"
,"Ahhaaa!"
"#02273","Wopaa!"
"#02274","=#00279"
"#02275","We won the Gold Game Garland!"
"#02276","My <co=0066cc><0></co> project is turning out perfectly."
"#02277","I believe that the <co=0066cc><0></co> would be most favorable."
"#02278","We've got a great project! What do you think about <co=0066cc><0></co>?"
"#02279","<co=0066cc><0></co> is my greatest project to date!"
"#02280","I implore you to choose <co=0066cc><0></co>!"
"#02281","I think the <co=0066cc><0></co> project will really stand out!"
"#02282","Good to meet you, Boss!"
,"Management Level Up has been added to the <co=0066cc>Development</co> menu!"
,"I'm waiting for your order whenever you have funds to spare!"
"#02283","Good to meet you, Boss!"
,"We've created a <co=0066cc>management game</co>!"
,"And a new menu has been added to Development!"
,"Use it to check on the games that you are managing!"
"#02284","Good to meet you, Boss!"
,"Oh!"
,"The <co=0066cc>development of a new platform</co> at our company is starting to gain a lot of backing too!"
,"It has been added to the Development menu. I await your orders!"
"#02285","Good to meet you, Boss!"
,"We need project planners to get involved in our company platform."
,"So, the Co-op Company you've acquired have been added to the Development Menu."
,"You'll need Stamina to do it, but if you feel ready, try some negotiations!"
"#02286","Good to meet you, Boss!"
,"A <co=0066cc>new Meeting Method</co> has been added!"
,"Looks like we'll be able to come up with even better ideas now!"
,"And with that - we got sent <co=0066cc>8 Coins</co>! You'll need those for meetings."
"#02287","Try holding a meeting now!"
"#02288","Yo. I was working in the area and thought I'd come by and say hello."
,"We can handle any of your <co=0066cc>furnishing</co> and <co=0066cc>expansion</co> needs at Bearington Construction!"
,"You can decide what you want me doing by going to Shops > <co=0066cc>Decorate Room</co>."
"#02289","Hey there, pardner!"
,"I sell a variety of useful goods which I have been amassing over the years."
,"If you ever need anything, just go to Shops > <co=0066cc>Bargin Shop</co> and I'll hook you up with whatever you need."
"#02290","Good to meet you, Boss!"
,"Meetings are getting more and more important and the time has come for you to become faster, stronger!"
,"Apparently, there are some new commands in the <co=0066cc>Shops</co> menu."
,"I wonder what we'll be able to do now?"
"#02291","Boss! You can now call on helpers when you start the next game development!"
,"Tap a helper at the bottom of the screen when development has begun."
"#02292","Looks like you <co=0066cc>don't have enough funds</co>. Let's develop more games for now!"
"#02293","Looks like that will <co=0066cc>exceed the maximum number</co> of Coins."
"#02294","Looks like that will <co=0066cc>exceed the maximum number</co> of Items."
"#02295","You don't have enough <co=0066cc>Meeting Points</co>. Develop games and use furniture to earn more."
"#02296","Hmmm, you don't have enough Coins for that..."
"#02297","Your Stamina is <co=0066cc>full</co>."
"#02298","We <co=0066cc>can't hire any more</co> <co=0066cc>staff members</co>. To hire <0>, you'll have to let somebody else go."
,"Who do you want to dismiss?"
"#02299","Very good! I shall get right to adding more floors!"
,"Heh heh heh!"
"#02300","Phew. Just as I promised, new floor's all ready for you!"
,"I think this might be the best work I've ever done..."
,"Just let me know if you need anything again."
"#02301","Looks like we have another wonderful new floor!"
,"Now we can hire even more staff to help us along on our development adventures!"
"#02302","You <co=0066cc>don't have enough Stamina</co> to go into development right now."
"#02303","A new project is still underway. Please wait until it has been finished."
"#02305","Okay, let's give up on this development and make up our losses on something new."
"#02306","Got it. I'll approach our staff for a new project right away!"
,"Please wait for a while until the project is finished."
"#02307","Looks like a new platform is going to be announced."
,"Let's go check it out right now!"
"#02308","Welcome back! You've <co=0066cc>logged in for 2 consecutive days</co>!"
,"Logging in for a 3rd or even 4th day will improve the rewards on the Login Roulette!"
,"Try and log in to the game every day."
"#02309","This is our first step towards making a game."
,"Let's get developing right away!"
"#02310","Pick a <co=0066cc>platform</co> to use. Choosing well is crucial to achieving high sales."
,"I have a feeling that <co=0066cc>the more employees we have</co>, the better sales will be too."
"#02311","The project plans your staff created have been delivered. What kind of game should we make?"
"#02312","Now, pick a sales plan."
,"Your strategy will affect things like the quality of the game and number of downloads."
"#02313","Next up, choose a development plan."
"#02314","Development can now be conducted on <co=0066cc>floors other than</co> the 1F."
,"It might be a good idea to exchange your current team with one that still has HP!"
"#02315","You can determine how effective your advertising tactics and management capabilities are for development."
,"It might be costly, but let's try and Level Up as much as we can!"
"#02316","Looks like we got some results straightaway! Let's keep leveling up from now on!"
"#02317","Hurrah! <name> has finally received an overseas release!"
,"Sure, it's pricey, but it's worth every penny!<br>North America might be a good start."
"#02318","<name>'s first game is now complete."
,"You can run up to 3 games at once, and as time passes you will receive a profit from them."
,"Set up your best games and check in on them every now and again."
"#02319","You can set a game to manage."
"#02320","The sales report of a game we are managing has come in!"
"#02321","Which game will you stop managing?"
"#02322","We're finally developing a platform of our own!"
"#02323","Tap confirm to begin development."
,"We can grow our workforce by adding various features to our platform."
,"Let's see how many features we can include!"
"#02324","We can have another company get involved with our platform."
,"We should see a <co=0066cc>sizeable increase</co> in staff!"
"#02325","Finally, it's time to develop! Get ready for the magic to happen!"
"#02326","I'm going to develop my socks off!"
"#02327","Tapping on a character with a full aura gauge will <co=ff0000>unleash</co> their full potential."
,"Skills have all different kinds of effects. Choose them wisely according to the situation!"
,"They'll gain more aura the more damage they take."
"#02328","Oh no! Looks like a staff member's HP is decreasing steadily."
,"Now it's in the hands of our faithful staff."
"#02329","Beginning the next step."
,"What kind of theme will this game have?"
"#02330","Moving to the next step."
,"What kind of method will we focus on this time?"
"#02331","We can use the helpers that we have now."
,"I heard that, as you proceed through development, there's a chance of finding new helpers."
"#02332","Whoa! There's a staff member who's run out of HP."
,"They won't be able to take part in development for a while. But, give them time and they'll recover."
"#02333","We've finished the game!"
"#02334","We have a few title ideas that the staff have come up with."
,"What do you think about <co=0066cc><0></co>?"
"#02335","Thanks to the recent development projects, we have some <co=0066cc>new applicants</co>!"
"#02336","The staff have had a <co=0066cc>eureka moment</co> during development!"
"#02337","<name> has finally finished creating its very first game!"
,"Time to put this game on the market and get as many people as we can to <co=0066cc>download</co> it!"
,"I can't wait to see how it does!"
"#02338","The download numbers aren't looking too bad."
,"Looks like something is happening!"
"#02339","Oh yeah! There's a staff member who can trigger their aura!"
,"Tap the staff member twice to activate their aura!"
"#02340","Oh no! We reached the deadline before everything could be finished."
,"Perhaps our staff still need to improve."
"#02341","Use items on staff to enhance their abilities."
,"It might be costly, but let's try and Power Up as much as we can!"
"#02342","You can keep up to 5 of each item at any time."
,"<co=0066cc>Tap the same item</co> once more to deselect it."
,"Press the confirm button at the bottom of the screen when you want to use the item."
"#02343","Your staff members seem to have gained some experience!"
"#02344","Whoa! Looks like this staff member has reached their max job level!"
,"I don't think you'll be able to train them any further right now."
,"You can always change their job role, but you'll need the <co=0066cc>necessary items</co> to do so first."
"#02345","Looks like you've acquired an item that recovers HP!"
,"They're great for <co=0066cc>tired staff</co> who have worked maybe a little too hard on development."
"#02346","Letting go of staff? Yeah, it's tough. But it's all part of the job."
"#02347","The dismissal is complete."
"#02348","You can check your staff's stats here."
,"It's always best to know exactly what your staff can do."
"#02349","Upgrading a staff member, huh?"
,"When a staff masters their job, they can then be upgraded."
,"If you have the necessary items for upgrading, use them with Power Up."
"#02350","Boss!"
,"There's a <co=0066cc>staff member who can be upgraded</co>!"
"#02351","They handled that upgrade like a pro!"
,"Now we can level them up even further than ever before!"
"#02352","This is where the CEO and staff brainstorm ideas, and <co=0066cc>come up with great innovations</co> for game development."
,"Sure, this CEO is pretty wet around the ears now."
,"But let's get them involved in lots of meetings and help them gain experience!"
"#02353","Here we can use a particularly rare Coin to hold a special meeting."
,"There'll be more people attending than a regular meeting and a higher chance of coming up with <co=0066cc>better ideas</co>."
,"Plus! Depending on the other users' CEO's skills you might be able to discover new staff and helpers."
,"Let's hold a meeting right away!"
"#02354","After a really enlightening discussion between the CEO and staff, it seems they have come up with some new ideas!"
"#02355","Here you can check the stockpile of <name>'s ideas."
"#02356","Why, hello there!"
,"Select either the <co=0066cc>furnishings</co> or <co=ff0000>floor plan</co> and take a look at what there is on offer."
"#02357","This is a wonderful product that will increase your floors and your <co=0066cc>staff</co>!"
,"Picking out some of those expensive items gets me hot under the collar."
"#02358","Welcome! Worry free and safe honey is Bearington Construction's motto."
"#02359","Please visit us again. We can even offer you better products the higher your Studio Rank."
"#02360","This is the menu for all the shops that will come in handy for running a business."
"#02361","Thanks again! I'm sellin' the goods you need to run a business at a reasonable cost!"
,"Please take a look at our wares."
"#02362","Welcome!"
"#02363","Come again!"
"#02364","Here you can check the games that you have made in the past."
"#02365","Here you can see all of your greatest achievements."
,"You might even be able to win some amazing prizes."
"#02366","Good to meet you, Boss!"
,"Look at you go! You've completed all the necessary requirements to receive an amazing prize!"
"#02367","Here you can see all of the users who have played your games."
,"Let's make lots of wonderful games for even more wonderful people!"
"#02368","Good to meet you, Boss!"
,"Gamedex is just round the corner."
,"What kind of exhibit do you want <name> to have this time?"
"#02369","Can't wait to see just how many customers we can bring in!"
,"I heard that the number of customers we get might affect the game's sales afterwards!"
"#02370","Can't wait to see just how many customers we can bring in!"
"#02371","We can expect <co=0066cc>more downloads</co> if we get people excited for our game at Gamedex!"
,"And if we keep doing well, even more customers will get interested in our game in the future."
,"Hm? Looks like you found an item during the event."
"#02372","This time's Gamedex ended on a high."
,"Hm? Looks like you found an item during the event."
"#02373","Looks like someone has stayed behind."
"#02374","We've made quite a few games now already."
,"I wouldn't be surprised if we started getting nominated for awards."
,"This commemorates an outstanding game, with the hopes of an even better game being created in the future."
,"<name> is registered for the <co=0066cc>Indie Games Award</co>, which focuses on new companies."
"#02375","Well now,"
,"It's finally time for the awards to be announced."
"#02376","Drum roll, please!"
,"This time round, <co=0066cc><name></co>'s game number <co=0066cc><0></co> has been nominated."
,"I can't wait to see if we win! Let's go to the awards hall!"
"#02377","Drum roll, please!"
,"Seems that <co=0066cc><name></co>'s game didn't get picked for the award."
,"Let's keep making good games and try and win next time."
"#02378","<co=0066cc>Studio Rank</co> has increased!"
,"As your rank increases, better products will become available to you, and you'll gain access to facilities for development."
,"Let's keep developing and aim for the highest rank we can!"
"#02379","Oh dear. It looks like you're <co=ff0000>running out of Stamina</co>."
,"Stamina <co=0066cc>recovers</co> even when you're not playing the game."
,"So it might be a good idea to wait a while before starting development again!"
"#02380","It looks like you're running short on funds."
,"Money is, of course, an essential component of development, but don't hold back on using it to train up staff up either."
,"That reminds me..."
,"I have a feeling I saw a wad of cash being used as a doorstop somewhere."
,"Ah-hah! Money really can solve anything! Anyway, here. Take this."
"#02381","By the way, you can <co=ff0000>develop a game</co> even when your money is <co=ff0000>in the red</co>."
,"Let's keep working on raising our sales and turn this company into an industry giant!"
"#02382","Gosh. And just like that, we don't have anymore Coins."
,"Coins are something of a rarity and should be used with caution. You can get a few more by playing through the game."
,"But, I've heard that you can also get them with the <co=0066cc>Login Roulette</co> too."
,"You want to make sure to use them where they really count. I may have seen some in the studio's toy box..."
,"Yes! There were some left in here! Go ahead, have them."
"#02383","<name> has so many staff members now that it's full to the brim!"
,"It might be wise to think about <co=0066cc>additional floors</co> next."
"#02384","Hello there! Additional floors? Then look no further!"
,"Come discuss what you need by going to Shops > <co=0066cc>Decorate Room</co>!"
"#02385","I'm feeling kinda lethargic. Maybe I'd feel better if I had something to eat."
"#02386","This is bound to come up as you play through the game."
"#02387","The new platform is finally complete!"
,"I'm so excited to see how many people will start playing our game!"
,"Oh yeah! What should we call it?"
"#02388","It's been some time since the game's release, and it seems like downloads are still good and steady."
,"Can't wait to see how many downloads we'll reach at this rate."
"#02389","<co=0066cc><0></co> has been newly added!"
,"It's an award that seems really worth striving for!"
"#02390","The Grand Games Show has come to an end."
"#02391","Whoa! Seems like your idea knowhow has increased."
,"As your knowhow increases, so too will your game's quality while in development."
,"So let's collect as much as we can!"
"#02392","This project has got a lot of hoopla surrounding it. We can expect great sales from this one."
"#02393","Seems you <co=ff0000>don't have enough Stamina</co> for that. Let's pick another project for now!"
,"As your Studio Ranks increases so too will your <co=0066cc>max Stamina</co>!"
"#02394","Whoa! Are you sure you want to quit development now?"
"#02395","I see..."
,"We'll try again next time."
"#02396","The game is no longer available to download."
,"A different genre's past ranking report just in!"
"#02397","An innovative idea for sure! Could be difficult to develop though."
,"We can gain a huge effect from this. It's all in the hands of our capable staff now!"
"#02398","<name> got a great new helper!"
"#02399","Let's keep upgrading our platforms! What kind of features should we add next?"
"#02400","Okay, let's develop this as a Free-to-Play."
"#02401","Let's keep managing this Free-to-Play even after it has been released."
"#02402","So, which game award shall we aim for this time?"
"#02403","Unfortunately, we weren't able to win the award."
,"So let's try again next time with an even better game!"
"#02404","Development of a sequel, huh?"
"#02405","Oh!"
,"The positive reviews kept piling in, and the game entered the hall of fame!"
,"Now you can start thinking about a sequel. It'd be a great chance to get even more downloads!"
"#02406","Your staff members ran out of HP and waited for the deadline to come."
"#02407","Development has finished. This game is looking to be <co=0066cc>very addictive</co>! Expect a high number of downloads!"
"#02408","Development has come to a close. This game has <co=0066cc>real punch</co>! Expect a large interest from the media!"
"#02409","Development has finished. This game <co=0066cc>feels great to play</co>! Expect lots of positive reviews!"
"#02410","Development has finished. This game has amazing <co=0066cc>social aspects</co>! Expect a positive influence on price and DLs!"
"#02411","Development has finished. This game has real <co=0066cc>lasting appeal</co>! Expect to make lots of long-term fans!"
"#02412","Development has finished. We've made ourselves a really good game here!"
"#02413","Hmm, let's call it a day on this one and start saving for the next project."
,"Gamedex is held after every 6th game you develop."
"#02414","We gave up on trying to get any items."
"#02415","This award will focus on the <co=0066cc><0></co> genre."
,"Until the next Grand Games Prize, let's try to make a <0> game!"
"#02416","I'm a little bit worried about our low HP, but let's give it our best!"
"#02417","There's a few bugs left. Let's use the <co=0066cc>debug</co> to ensure that they're all squashed before the game's release!"

"#02435","Phew! The architectural knowhow that I've been honing all these years has finally come in handy."

"#02436","What kind of game should we manage?"
"#02437","We'll manage the game that you have specified."
"#02438","You have set for no projects in the <0> genre to be planned."
,"The staff will now not offer to make <0> games."

,"If you delete this you won't be able to receive any more. So be careful!"
"#02444","Seems like this hasn't installed yet."
"#02445","There aren't enough gifts. It's going to be tricky adding anymore floors."
,"You know, getting friends to send you some gifts might not be a bad idea."
"#02446","If you log in here everyday,"
,"you'll be able to spin a Special Roulette! So make sure to log in everyday and collect that treasure!"
"#02447","Development is finally beginning!"
,"It'll take some time for the project plan to be completed."
,"It'll keep progressing even if you close the game."

"#02463","At what age did that happen?"
"#02464","=#01346"
"#02465","<co=0066cc><0></co> started."
"#02466","Yeah, I suppose that can happen to anybody."
"#02467","An excellent answer in my opinion."
"#02468","Heh heh. Nice to meet you!"
,"I'll give it my all to become the most CEO-ie CEO you've ever seen!"
,"Actually, about my <co=0066cc>name</co>..."
,"Could you tell me what it is?"
"#02469","That's such a beautiful name. I'm... I'm touched, thank you."
,"Now I think about it, am I a boy?"
,"Or maybe a girl?"
"#02470","I was reading a magazine earlier on and came across an article on vampires' favorite blood type."
,"But I've no idea what blood type I am, so I'm not sure if I need to protect myself or not."
,"Could you tell me what my <co=0066cc>blood type</co> is? Please..."
,"You just never know when you might run into one. Can't have garlic on me all the time."
"#02471","Come to think of it, I got asked my age the other day."
,"I told them to guess, but when they did I wasn't actually sure if they were right or not."
,"Could you tell me <co=0066cc>how old</co> I am?"
"#02472","I thought I might try eating food in order to blend in better with other humans."
,"But what you do think I should eat for my first meal?"
"#02473","I'm coming to the age now..."
,"where I think it's about time that I have a hobby."
,"There's all sorts of hobbies from the looks of it, like watching baseball or sumo."
"#02474","By the way..."
,"I was watching TV earlier, and saw a program about what kids want to be when they grow up."
,"There were so many kinds of jobs that I started getting excited myself."
,"By the way..."
"#02475","By the way..."
,"There was a program on TV where a celebrity visited their hometown."
,"Got me thinking, having a hometown is pretty neat. If I had a nice hometown, I think I'd like to go visit it too."
"#02476","By the way..."
,"A kid was talking so excitedly about their aspirations for the future. Said they wanted to be something called a ""Kairobot."""
,"By the way, I..."
"#02477","By the way..."
,"I'm finally going to start exercising tomorrow! At least, if I keep thinking like this, I know it'll happen someday."
,"Everyone always says, do what you love. Do I really love this though..."
"#02478","To tell the truth, I've been playing this game for a long time now."
,"But I just can't seem to complete it. Now I'm playing it as I look up stuff on the Internet."
,"By the way, I..."
"#02479","Anyway, can I ask you something?"
,"Umm..."
"#02480","Actually..."
,"There's something that has been bothering me for a while now..."
,"Gulp..."
"#02481","Recently I have discovered that there is something called ""friendship."""
,"But I've never seen it before. Do you think it'd taste nice? I wonder what it could be about?"
"#02482","I see, I see. That does sounds rather delicious."
,"I can feel myself becoming a little more human every day."
"#02483","Hmm. I see."
,"That could be useful."
"#02484","Hmm. I see."
,"If I ever resign as CEO, I think that for my next job I'd like to be a...CEO."
"#02485","But I'm making games now! Who knew?!"
,"It'll be a source of great confidence for me, as CEO, you know. Hee hee."
"#02486","Hmm, you lived in a nice part of town, huh?"
"#02487","Hmm, that was quite a dream."
,"I learnt a lot."
"#02488","Hmm. I see."
,"That strikes me as a good daily routine to follow."
"#02489","I knew it! I suspected that all along."
"#02490","Hmm, that's some nice treasure."
"#02491","Hmm, so that's the kind of family, is it?"
"#02492","Heh heh heh! Ho ho ho!"
"#02493","I see. So it wasn't food after all!"
,"Anyway, I'm gonna work hard on my popularity too."
"#02494","Oh yes, so cute!"
"#02495","Time really does fly when you're having fun, doesn't it?"
,"Wow, I was so engrossed that I didn't notice today become tomorrow!"
,"What was I so engrossed in? Well, err..."
"#02496","By the way..."
"#02497","Ah..."
,"Life is full of ups and downs..."
,"I was thinking of getting a T-Shirt made with that on it."
"#02498","It feels good to be praised in front of others!"
,"That's what I was thinking anyway."
,"But then I wondered whether it had ever happened to me."
"#02499","You know, a little earlier..."
,"The person came to read my meter and work out my bill..."
,"But I really needed an abacus to check their calculations."
,"So, I've just ordered one online."
"#02500","I was watching this program about best places to live..."
,"It really made me feel like moving!"
,"Before that..."
"#02501","Ouch!"
,"I caught my finger in a drawer, but fortunately it wasn't too bad."
,"But would you look at this scar?!"
"#02502","I'm gonna have some fun during the upcoming holiday!"
,"Where shall I go?♪"
"#02503","Oh, oh no..."
,"You don't look on tip top shape..."
,"Yeah, despite eating and sleeping well..."
"#02504","We should be proud of our achievements."
,"I thought about having it printed on a mug and giving it to my friend."
"#02505","That reminds me..."
,"Loads of people collect stamps these days. I read about it in a book a while ago."
,"I thought, I wanna do that! I wanna make it my life work..."
"#02506","What a pain when it snows and the trains are all messed up."
,"Especially when you've got somewhere really important to get to."
,"That reminds me..."
"#02507","So, routines and hobbies are not the same, are they?"
,"I was just thinking, is there anything that I do every day?"
,"I'm still thinking..."
"#02508","Oof!"
,"I ate some cake before going to bed, and now my cheeks hurt..."
,"Actually, it's not so much my cheeks, it's more my..."
"#02509","You really can't beat a field trip, can you?"
,"Out in a forest, surrounded by nature, or lining up with friends to get to the summit of a mountain..."
,"Eating sandwiches on the summit and looking down... That feeling of floating in the sky."
,"And you gotta eat some candy after the sandwiches, of course."
"#02510","So, I was preparing for an interview for a waiting job."
,"I love reading, so I thought I'd talk about comics during the interview."
,"I imagine they'll ask me about what sort of people I look up to..."
"#02511","I was watching this race on TV the other day."
,"It was the first time that the runner had ever won anything, and the commentator was getting all excited too."
,"It's a great thing to succeed after trying hard, huh?"
"#02512","So I was playing this food game in the arcade the other day."
,"You know, the one where you hit all those buttons and the food rains down..."
,"I forgot to hit the buttons for a moment, and I won all this stuff!"
,"But it just made me want to play and win all the more."
"#02513","Studying really is a good thing, right?"
,"That joy of learning something you didn't know..."
,"I'd like to be the sort of person who says that. First I've got these comics to read."
,"Well, they aren't going to read themselves, are they?"
"#02514","Do you remember when you first earned money from work?"
,"It's just so much more valuable than pocket money, right?"
,"Of course, I've spent it all now, but..."
"#02515","Wait, you didn't build secret bases as a kid?"
,"I was thinking in the bath about what those bases might have become by now, if we'd really made them."
,"If I was going to live alone, I'd like to live in a secret base."
"#02516","I was thinking about doing some magic tricks at the office Christmas party..."
,"I didn't want to risk sawing someone in half..."
,"But all I know how to do is bend spoons with my mind."
,"I want to come up with something cool and exciting."
"#02517","Hey, I found this disposable camera at the back of a draw."
,"I can't get the film developed. I wonder what's on it."
,"When was the last time I went on vacation?"
,"I'll never forget that place that I went. Where was it now?"
"#02518","So, I was clearing out the cupboards, you know."
,"And I found my passport and bug repellent."
,"It's so long since I went overseas. I wonder if the repellent still works..."
"#02519","Haven't you noticed how it's always the same people who voice anime?"
,"It's true. Pay attention next time you watch one."
,"I checked the credits and it's like 80% the same voice actors!"
"#02520","You know if you put a book under your pillow when you go to bed,"
,"you'll dream about that book! It's true, old wives say so!"
,"I'm gonna try it next time. Maybe not with the horror novel I'm reading though..."
"#02521","Hey, have you seen how cheap our phone bills are nowadays?"
,"You can call for free over the Internet, of course."
,"I was gonna call up all my friends, but I've lost my phone!"
,"Yeah, I know..."
"#02522","Games, eh? Are they great or are they great?!"
,"I just can't stop playing them. The other day I played all through the night!"
,"You know, all you need to make your own games, is to understanding computer code."
,"Before that..."
"#02523","By the way..."
,"They've opened this French restaurant nearby, so I decided to raid my piggy bank and go one night."
,"But then I heard that they had a dress code..."
,"I was so worried about what to wear that I ate a load of snacks while choosing my outfit."
"#02524","It must be great to own your own shop."
,"I'd love to run my own shop too."
,"Actually, if they made a game about that, I'd play that instead."
"#02525","Sports drinks are actually quite tasty if you refrigerate them enough you know."
,"I'm researching the very best temperature to drink them at."
,"It kinda depends on what you've been doing first though..."
"#02526","By the way..."
,"You know, when you read a book, it really fires your imagination."
,"It's not the same with movies, so I sometimes sneak off to the toilet to read my book."
"#02527","Movies are amazing, aren't they? You gotta watch them at the theater, though..."
,"Brings tears to my eyes sometimes. Not every time, you understand."
,"Movies I watch a lot, huh? Lemme think about it..."
"#02528","I was watching this program on TV and the commercial break just went on and on!"
,"It was, like, longer than the program!"
,"I tell you what, though; I'm not buying that Kentucky Boiled Gammon!"
"#02529","By the way..."
,"What do I remember? That's a hard one to answer!"
,"It's not a question you get asked often, but you never know when you might get asked it!"
,"Ah, that reminds me..."
"#02530","Dagnabbit!"
,"I'm madder than a mad thing!"
,"What was it again?"
"#02531","A-ha ha ha!"
,"This comic is hilarious. Who knew a flying dog could be so funny?"
,"I don't remember the last time I laughed this hard!"
"#02532","There was this thing on TV the other day."
,"Talking about those little everyday things that make our lives happier."
,"It made me start thinking about what they were for me."
"#02533","You know, they say that failure is the mother of success."
,"You could go further and say that challenges are the grandmother of success."
,"I have to say that challenges and failure just make me feel down..."
"#02534","Oh yeah..."
,"You know I saw a documentary about vegetarian dolphins."
,"They have to dive really deep to find seaweed. So cool."
"#02535","Have you ever tried jellied eels?"
,"They are amazing! Amazing I tell you!"
,"They go really well with parsley sauce and a splash of vinegar..."
,"Good with mashed potato too."
"#02536","I was just thinking about this year's popular words..."
,"I don't think I've ever used any of them in a sentence."
,"I reckon I'll have forgotten what they are by next year anyway."
,"For example..."
"#02537","You know how people always ask you what your hopes for the future are?"
,"Don't you find that they often change? Your hopes, that is?"
,"So, err, what are your hopes for the future then?"
"#02538","So, you know I was talking about my visit to the bank?"
,"The strap broke on my bag on the way and all my stuff fell out."
,"I dropped my bank cards and when I got to the bank, I couldn't get any money out!"
"#02539","This is just between the two of us, but..."
,"when I was a kid I wanted to be a superhero."
,"So I went around trying to get bitten by spiders and stuff."
"#02540","You know they say that the early bird catches the worm?"
,"Why would you get out of bed to eat worms?!"
,"I'd rather lie in and then have some toast."
,"Who decides what's late and what's early anyway?"
"#02541","O when the saints come marching in... ♪"
,"The voice of an angel, eh? I practice a lot in the bath you know, with the shower head."
,"I once sprayed myself in the face by accident singing Elvis..."
"#02542","You know I was saving all my pennies in an old piggy bank at home."
,"But the plug in the belly had come out, and my brother was collecting all the coins that fell out."
,"He's richer than me now, the little thief!"
"#02543","You know when you have a favorite comic artist?"
,"You want to collect their entire works, don't you? Even the rubbish stuff."
,"It becomes like an obsession, but you just have to get them all."
,"I don't know where I'm gonna put all my comics..."
"#02544","That reminds me..."
,"My friend won this poetry competition the other day. With a poem from his college course."
,"But it was so bad; all written in some weird northern dialect..."
"#02545","What about ramen, eh? Isn't it just the most delicious thing?"
,"It's all down to the broth, or so they say."
,"I could really eat a bowl of ramen right now..."
"#02546","Hey, thanks for coming again. You're like my best friend ever!"
,"I mean it, I really do. You are just always there for me."
,"So, umm, I was wondering; could you lend me some money?"
"#02547","Just a second ago..."
,"This insurance broker came up to me in the street..."
,"And told me I was going to die, so I had to buy some life assurance."
,"Well, you know what? I bought it. Just in case. Not that I believed him or anything."
"#02548","Hahaha, now that you mention it..."
,"I suppose I'm not an adult. I mean, I'm old enough, but I don't act it."
,"And I think that is why you said what you did, right?"
,"Right?"
"#02549","By the way..."
,"They say that there's a super volcano beneath out very feet!"
,"Can you imagine if it erupts? All this a smoking river of lava..."
,"Wouldn't that be cool? Well, hot, but cool, I mean..."
"#02550","There comes a point in life when you start giving rather than receiving presents."
,"Umm..."
"#02551","I'm thinking of arranging a little trip for the family. Not sure where to go though..."
,"Umm..."
"#02552","We're so pleased that you like our games so much."
,"We're really, really grateful. Kairobot's been fluxing his capacitors with joy."
,"So, I was saying, ""relax, you bought it in an accredited shop; it will be fine..."""
,"Anyway..."
"#02553","That's right! I fell in love with it immediately too."
,"I can feel myself becoming a little more human every day."
"#02554","Yeah, I love it too!"
"#02555","Yeah, I'm a bit of a fan too!"
"#02556","Let's get some T-shirts printed immediately! I reckon they'll sell like hotcakes!"
,"Thanks!"
"#02557","It's only thanks to quality souvenirs like those that I can live a life of happiness and contentment."
"#02558","I feel a lot better about myself since receiving that award..."
"#02559","Over the moon! Just thinking about it gives me a warm feeling!"
"#02560","Oof, I ordered this thing online, but I got 100 copies of something completely different!"
,"I want to send them back for a refund, but there're 100 of them!"
"#02561","Yep, no doubt about it; all that hard work is paying off now."
"#02562","Ooh, this is nice! I like it here."
,"No way am I moving from here!"
"#02563","There's no getting away from it; you need to take care of your health."
,"Robot that I am, I like to treat myself to a little oil bath every now and then."
"#02564","Ow! Just remembering it hurts!"
"#02565","They say that your body is capital. For the sake of the company you need to stay in shape."
"#02566","I'm gonna have so much fun this weekend!"
"#02567","I just can't wait to go out!"
"#02568","That's me out the door for the weekend!"
,"Oh, wait, no! Time for work already!"
"#02569","Just hearing about it has put me into an emotional nosedive..."
,"Sleep, that will let me forget; if only for a short while."
"#02570","That is...a shame."
"#02571","OMG! I wish I hadn't asked now!"
"#02572","Oh wow! I need to get that printed on a mug!"
,"And I did, but it was all wrong. I'm too embarrassed to show my face now!"
,"But I ain't givin' up! No way, Jose!"
"#02573","Sounds good. If I should ever be in the mood and have the time, I might..."
,"We could do such good work together. Maybe."
"#02574","You're right! Now I really feel up for the challenge now!"
,"But I'm, err, just going to catch forty winks first, okay?"
"#02575","Oh man, I'm telling you, I could not put it down!"
,"It's uncanny, isn't it? How fate works, I mean, destiny, you know..."
"#02576","That's good! We're clearly on the same wavelength."
"#02577","That snow stopped me getting to the examination center!"
,"It's always good to have a bit of time spare."
"#02578","Yep, I've been working hard, under the radar. I'm not in it for the accolades."
"#02579","No surprise at all. I'd always considered them a subject matter expert."
"#02580","What a good idea! I'm going to do the same every day from now on."
,"Well, maybe."
"#02581","It hurts, doesn't it?!"
,"But there's something strangely relaxing about the pain, huh?"
"#02582","Oof, just thinking about the treatment, makes my teeth hurt."
"#02583","I'm not wrong, huh?"
"#02584","I don't know them very well, but they're pretty amazing, huh?"
,"I'll have to check 'em out online when I get the chance."
"#02585","Yeah, they really are amazing. I'm so full of respect."
"#02586","Now I remember; how excited I was to win! I'll never forget that feeling...again."
"#02587","Victory! What a lovely surprise. We are the champions, my friend..."
"#02588","What a feeling to win like this! We are brilliant!"
"#02589","I was looking in some drawers when I found this medal!"
,"I think this is the medal I got that time for that thing. Yes, definitely..."
"#02590","Ho ho ho! That's right! Ha ha, I'm overjoyed at that!"
"#02591","Well, if you're pushing me, then I suppose I'd say yes."
"#02592","That's very impressive. Very impressive indeed."
"#02593","I think I'll follow the same principles as CEO."
"#02594","I bet it was a really sweet apartment."
"#02595","Ha ha, you can be sure that I'm gonna brag about that forever."
,"I'm over the moon!"
"#02596","He he, I reckon I'll brag about that too."
"#02597","It's always good to have something new to show off about."
"#02598","I want to go on holiday again. I didn't take enough photos when I went last time!"
"#02599","You've been to some cool places, huh? I need to get out more. If only it would stop raining!"
"#02600","I saw this great place in a travel magazine. I really, really want to visit!"
"#02601","I want to travel the world! Go on a journey of self-discovery..."
"#02602","I'm afraid of flying, but I'm gonna work up my courage and go!"
"#02603","That's the spirit! I just need to get myself a passport now!"
"#02604","Ah, so it was that sort of anime, huh?"
,"I'm going to watch it every night from today!"
"#02605","Hmm, that's a great manga."
,"I read it every night before bed. I've memorized all of the text."
"#02606","Really? That's the first I've heard of it! Maybe you can lend it?"
"#02607","You've all got a copy, right? Of the world famous, err, Kairosoft, was it? Their newest game!"
"#02608","Yeah, I've got a copy. Can you help with the installation?"
"#02609","Yeah, you've only gotta look at it to know that!"
"#02610","It's not really that kind of place, you know."
,"I'd really like to play it as a game."
"#02611","So, I'd like to get started with the necessary equipment."
"#02612","What a great book! I can't wait to go to the toilet with it!"
"#02613","Is that right? Well, in that case, I can't wait to take it to bed with me tonight!"
"#02614","That movie? Right, I'll see if I can't stream it on Nutflix..."
,"But I suppose I'll have to make an account first!"
"#02615","It was such a great movie! I just watched it yesterday!"
"#02616","Really? In that case I'm gonna watch it too. Once I've finished my boxsets, that is."
"#02617","Really? I'll keep an eye out for when they repeat it."
"#02618","Wow, that really takes me back. Like being hit with the nostalgia stick."
,"I doubt I'll forget it either."
"#02619","Yup, I know what you mean, something similar happened to me."
,"Yeah, I really feel like doing that!"
"#02620","Yes, something like that did happen, didn't it?"
,"I think something like that might have happened to me too!"
"#02621","..."
,"Even I got angry over that!"
"#02622","That's understandable! It would make me furious too!"
"#02623","Hee hee hee, that really is funny, isn't it?"
"#02624","A-ha ha ha! That's a classic!"
"#02625","That's good to hear. Makes me really happy."
"#02626","Don't worry, be happy!"
"#02627","Really, don't worry, be happy!"
"#02628","No, really, really, don't worry, be happy!"
"#02629","That's all well and good, but what about those vegetarian dolphins?"
"#02630","The seaweed-eating ones? They call 'em kelpies, you know."
"#02631","Kelpies, huh? That's interesting."
,"Once I get interested in something, I find that I just can't sleep afterwards."
,"Zzz..."
"#02632","Now that you mention it, it is a bit of a concern."
,"I hate waiting..."
"#02633","Yes, I remember. How could I forget a thing like that?"
"#02634","You're right there. You can't help but love it."
"#02635","Wow, that really is amazing. I'm hooked!"
,"Really?"
"#02636","Really? That?"
,"I'm gonna buy it straightaway too!"
"#02637","I want to transform into a pixie and flutter around town..."
"#02638","I see. It's that kind of lifestyle, is it?"
,"I'm very much in the sleep as long as you can club."
"#02639","I was just listening to that album!"
,"It's good, isn't it?!"
"#02640","I heard it playing in a cafe the other day."
,"I stayed in the cafe right up to closing time because of that album."
"#02641","You know what I'd really like to travel in?"
,"A time machine or a space elevator. Or maybe not, I'm not sure."
"#02642","What a great company! In another life I would have liked to be CEO of that company."
,"Or maybe just a shareholder in it."
"#02643","Yeah, that announcement really shook the world."
,"I reckon we can expect something similar next time too."
"#02644","What? That's famous as all Heck, you know!"
,"Is that right?!"
"#02645","Oof, I was every bit as nervous as I thought I'd be."
,"I know what you mean. I get butterflies in my stomach in front of people."
"#02646","Wearing my glasses meant I could see them all staring at me!"
,"I reckon I'll take 'em off next time."
"#02647","He he he. Thanks. Thanks for everything."
"#02648","Is that right? Well, I'm happy to hear it!"
,"If you could pass on my message, I'd be much obliged."
"#02649","Kids are a treasure to be cherished."
"#02650","Kids are..."
,"A treasure to be cherished."
"#02651","Yes, yes..."
,"It's because kids are a treasure after all."
"#02652","Yes, yes..."
,"Four people? That's amazing!"
"#02653","Err..."
